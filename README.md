# Mieps

A single-server Typescript Discord bot with a simple plugin System.
Includes following Plugins:

## Plugins

* Block Links: deletes Messages from non-members containing links
* Freeze: Temporarily revokes write privileges for members in a channel
* Join Greetings: Greets new users
* Message Mover: Moves, copies, or deletes single or many Messages
* Optional Channels: Allows Members to join, or leave, optional Channels
* Self Assign Role: Allows Members to give themselves roles, based on aliases
* Warnings: Used for Moderators to write warnings, in case of member misconduct

Except for "Self Assign Roles" all plugins can be fully configured through the server. Use the command "!plugin" to get started.

Do not invite Mieps to more than one server! (For now), Mieps only works on one server at a time.

## Images

Please note that while the bot itself is licensed under MIT, the images it uses are not. While I do not generally mind the use of these images, do not claim ownership over them, or modify them. You are always free to replace the Images with your own.
